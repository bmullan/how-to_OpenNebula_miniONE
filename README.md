# HOW-TO Install/Configure OpenNebula miniONE to use LXD as the VM Hypervisor

refernce:  openNebula.org

**OpenNebula** is a simple yet powerful and flexible turnkey open-source solution to build Private Clouds and manage Data Center virtualization. OpenNebulaâ€™s maturity builds upon over a decade of software releases and thousands of enterprise deployments, being widely used by industry and research leaders.

OpenNebula's **miniONE** (ONE being an acronym for **O**pen**NE**bula) lets you quickly experiment with using LXD as the VM Hypervisor for OpenNebula.

NOTE:  miniONE is **NOT** a substitute for utilizing the full version of the opensource OpenNebula itself.

I made [this short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RGtCd2E7XmUSK1tWIkDa1IA4E6YBa0RM/view) to demonstrate how easy it is to install _**miniONE**_ in a KVM VM and create two LXD OpenNebula "VMs" using standard LXD images.
